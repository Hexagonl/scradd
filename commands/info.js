				)}>. This is useful for cases such as the following:\n- when you want to [highlight a good piece of work made by someone in the server](https://canary.discord.com/channels/806602307750985799/938809898660155453/943246143452770364) so more people see it\n- when you want to [give somone credit for making or saying something funny](https://canary.discord.com/channels/806602307750985799/938809898660155453/944108757686841344)\n- when someone says [something that without context makes no sense](https://canary.discord.com/channels/806602307750985799/938809898660155453/941848293170876486)\n- and etcetera.\n\nYou cannot react to your own messages with ${escape(
					BOARD_EMOJI,
				)} to prevent abusing the potatoboard. Also, if Scradd autoreacts to a message with ${escape(
					BOARD_EMOJI,
				)}, it does not count towards the ${escape(
					MIN_REACTIONS + "",
				)} needed to be posted.\n\nYou can use the [\`/explorepotatoes\`](https://github.com/scratchaddons-community/scradd/blob/main/commands/explorepotatoes.js) command to find a random message from the potatoboard. You can filter by the user or by minimum number of ${escape(
					BOARD_EMOJI,
				)} reactions.\n\nMost of the code handling potatoboard starts from [messageReactionAdd.js](https://github.com/scratchaddons-community/scradd/blob/main/events/messageReactionAdd.js).`,

The OP may also run the \`/suggestion edit\` command to edit the suggestion if they made a typo or something like that. Finally, the \`/suggestion get-top\` command can be used to get the top suggestions. By default it returns all suggestions, but you can filter by the suggestion‚Äôs OP and/or the suggestion‚Äôs answer. This can be used to find things such as your most liked suggestions, suggestions you could go answer, suggestions you could implement, and so on.\n\nSimilar \`/bugreport\` commands also exist but with a few key differences: the words used in the commands are slightly different, no reactions are added to reports, the possible answers are different, and there is no \`/bugreport get-top\`.`,

If sending any message fails, I will react with <:no:940054047854047282>. I will DM the user any messages ${mod}s send in the thread (anonymously; the ${mod}s‚Äô identities are not revealed), following the same reaction rules. Reactions, replies, edits, and deletes are not supported.\nWhen the ticket is resolved, a ${mod} can use the \`/modmail close\` command to lock the thread, edit the thread strting message to indicate its closed status, and DM the user. The ${mod} can specify a reason that will be posted in the thread as well as sent to the user. \n\nIf the ${mod}s want to contact a user for any reason, they can use the \`/modmail start\` command to start a modmail with a user themselves. It will open a new thread in <#${escape(
					MODMAIL_CHANNEL,
				)}> and DM the user that a Modmail has been started. The ${mod}s can then ask the user what they need to ask, for instance, requesting them to change an innappropriate status.`,

Don\‚Äôt specify a filter to get a random addon. You can click on the addon\‚Äôs name to get a link straight to the settings page to enable it.\n- [\`/info\`](https://github.com/scratchaddons-community/scradd/blob/main/commands/info.js) (this command): A help command to learn more about the bot and its functions.\n- [\`/say\`](https://github.com/scratchaddons-community/scradd/blob/main/commands/say.js): A ${mod}-only (to prevent abuse) command that makes me mimic what you tell me to say.

These are not needed to be kept secret. They are: prompt users to use `/suggestion create` instead of `r!suggest`,tell people not to ping others when using `r!mimic`, and call people out when they abuse the spoiler hack. The source code for these is in [`messageCreate.js`](https://github.com/scratchaddons-community/scradd/blob/main/events/messageCreate.js).",
